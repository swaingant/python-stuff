for n in range (1,185):

	time.sleep(.060)



# By default print() has 2 parameters
#
#	end -> Its default value is \n
#	sep -> It separates all values in print by a space
#
# By changing end="", i am changing its default value to "none".

#	Example of sep:
#	>>> print(2,3,4,5,6,7)
#	2 3 4 5 6 7
#	>>> print(2,3,4,5,6,7,sep="*")
#	2*3*4*5*6*7
